# picobrew
Pieces of code for biomedical research work (in Python)

## Introduction

In my biomedical-related research, a lot of common functions (e.g., plotting heatmap of hierarchical clustering) are recurrently used, but Python may not have a good evolope for them (good thing, users have more flexibilities). It usually took me quite a few minutes to find these pieces of code from my previous work and a few more minutes to adapt to the current work.

The goal of the picobrew (**PI**eces of **CO**de for **B**iomedical/Bioinformatics **RE**search **W**ork) is to save the time for these kinds of work by sorting the pieces of code into well-packed cleaned functions.
